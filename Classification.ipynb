    "One of the convenience functions that we imported above is called ```train_test_split```.  As its name suggests, this function splits a dataset into separate training and testing sets.  The [online documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html?highlight=train_test_split#sklearn-model-selection-train-test-split) indicates that it splits a dataset randomly, such that approximately 25% of the data winds up in the test set and the remaining 75% in the training set.  The documentation is a bit confusing, since the function can take a variable number of arrays as inputs; in our case, we want to split up 2 arrays (```x_scaled``` and ```y```) into coordinated test and train sets, so that the function will return a total of 4 subarrays (```x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test```).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ```train_test_split``` generates random splits of the input data, each time we call the function we will get a different split.  Sometimes it is useful, for the purposes of code development, to be able to get reproducible random numbers or random splits, which can then be relaxed once one wishes to generate statistics over many random runs.     With ```train_test_split```, this can be accomplished by using the ```random_state``` option; if specified with that state as an integer, then the same random split will be generated each time the function is called (until one changes the value of the integer).  This is known as providing a seed to the pseudo-random number generator that is used by ```train_test_split```.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, enter and execute a call to ```train_test_split``` that takes ```x_scaled``` and ```y``` as inputs, along with the optional parameter ```random_state=0```, and returns the 4 data subsets mentioned above, to be named as ```x_train```, ```x_test```, ```y_train```, ```y_test```.  The online documentation provides an example of what such a function call looks like. After the function call, print the shapes of each of the four arrays that are returned."

One way of assessing the performance of a classifier is by computing its accuracy on the test data, that is, what fraction of the test data are correctly predicted by the classifier.  Fortunately, `sklearn` provides a built-in function named ```accuracy_score``` that carries out this computation; we imported it above, and you can read more about it in the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html?highlight=accuracy_score#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score).\n",

Under the hood, these are very different types of algorithms.  Decision Trees try to formulate a series of yes/no questions based on the data that can distinguish the categories from one another.  SVMs, on the other hand, use techniques from geometry to find cuts through the data space to separate different categories from one another.  Understanding how these methods work in detail is beyond the scope of this exercise, but fortunately, despite the very different data structures and algorithms used internally, `sklearn` provides a uniform interface that lets us easily build these different sorts of classifiers and compare their performance.\n",
